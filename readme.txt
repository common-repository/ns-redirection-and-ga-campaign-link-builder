Easily create Google Analytics Campaign URLs with all the proper parameters and wire them to friendly URLs for use in landing pages, newsletters, plugins, forums, etc. with built in redirection all in one plugin!

== Description ==

This plugin simplifies the process and combines the power of redirection in WordPress and campaign links in Google Analytics to generate special URLs that you can use wherever you want to keep detailed tracking on your conversion sources and metrics. This is the same kind of tracking used by expensive tools and services like Improvely, MailChimp, etc. Why pay for all that fancy reporting when Google Analytics will report the same data if it is fed the right information. This plugin automates feeding it the right info.

= How to Use = 

1. You must have a Google Analytics tracking code already active on your site.
2. The plugin includes built in guidance on what each field is for.
3. For each campaign URL that you want to make, you specify a "friendly URL" that you will share.
4. This "friendly URL" doesn't actually exist on your site, but this plugin will redirect it to the actual campaign URL.
5. When you fill out all the required fields, and save the new entry, this plugin maps your friendly URL to the campaign URL on your site which is a combination of an actual post or page and all the parameters needed for Google Analytics to collect the right data.
6. Inside Google Analytics you will be able to find all your campaign data. And, with e-commerce tracking enabled, you will be able to track sales per campaign and other metrics.
